Cube files are very common in computational chemistry to describe volumetric
data (e.g., electron density).
As per the CUBE file format specification described at
http://h5cube-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cubeformat.html
all quantities are in atomic units.
Consequently, volumetric data is in units of 1/Bohr^3, which is sometimes
inconvenient for atomic physicists.
The accompanying Python script converts the volumetric data to 1/Angstrom^3.
It also allows to (linearly) interpolate the original data to a different grid
size.
